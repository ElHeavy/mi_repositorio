    <h1>EL HEAVY'S GEAR</h1>
<img src="../assets/img/Guitarra.jpg" alt="Guitarra">

    <p>Dean Guitars, a pioneer in Heavy Metal  guitars, welcomes guitar virtuoso El Heavy to its family of
        artists.

        El Heavy is always pushing the boundaries of what the guitar can do, and he needs an instrument that can keep up
        with his creativity and technique. “A good friend of mine turned me on to Dean guitars and I was immediately
        intrigued,” Cooley says. “The guitar played great and had a very cutting-edge and innovative look. After
        speaking with Perry I knew this was the right move for me. Finally a guitar builder with the vision to go where
        no-one else has ever been, and the balls to do it!”</p>
